        <h2> Ingredients:</h>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups flour (250 grams or 1/4 kg)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar (100 grams)</li>
                <li>3 Eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup liquid milk (240ml)</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup warm water</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract substitute with half a teaspoon of ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons oil</li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Method:</h2>
           <ol>
		<li>In a large bowl whisk together the flour, sugar and salt. (that is mix all dry ingredients first)</li>
                <li>Add in the water, milk, vanilla extract and 2 and a half tablespoons of the oil. Then mix together to form a batter.</li>
                <li>Beat the eggs then add to the batter and mix to incorporate.</li>
		<li>Heat a frying pan on medium heat. Add in about 1 teaspoon of the remaining oil. Spread the oil around to coat the bottom of the pan. Let it heat up for about 2 minute</li>
                <li>Pour in about a quarter cup of the batter into the frying pan (you may need more or less of this depending on the size of your frying pan. You just need enough to coat the bottom.)</li>
                <li>Let the side down the pancake cook for about 2 minutes then use a spatula (or an eating spoon haha!) to flip it to the other side and let it cook for 1-2 minutes. Remove and place on a tray.</li>
		<li>For the next pancake, place the batter on the hot frying pan without any added oil and let it cook the same way the first one cooked. (Note that no added oil is need here because the batter already contains oil. However, if your frying pan is not smooth on the inside then the batter might stick to the pan. In this case, skip adding oil to the batter and add about half a teaspoon of oil before cooking the subsequent pancakes.)</li>
                <li>Serve your Cameroonian pancakes warm - I love serving them with some chocolate drizzled over them and some fruits. So good!</li>               
           </ol>
